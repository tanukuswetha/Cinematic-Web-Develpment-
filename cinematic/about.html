        <p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">It can be an interesting experience looking around at websites in particular industries to identify trends and see how they differ from those in other industries. In this article,
we’ll take a look at the websites of major motion pictures to see what types of websites are being created. Movies are a big part of the entertainment industry, and in recent years 
their websites have become increasingly critical to their overall success.</p>
<p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">So why a movies website?</p>
<p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Movies are made to entertain audiences, and movie websites are much the same. In order to get visitors’ attention and encourage them to see the movie, a website needs to give them 
what they are looking for and provide some entertainment at the same time. Today’s movie websites make it easy to take a couple minutes and watch a few trailers before deciding which movie to see.</p>
<p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">What’s so special in this page?</p>
<p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The website CINEMATIC doesn't encourage piracy websites, so we the team CINEMATIC have used some of the famous sites like Netflix, amazon prime, IMDB (amazon subsidiary) etc.</p>
<p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Why like that?</p>
<p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">As Piracy has been a global issue since 1980. It rapidly increased after the advancement in media technology such as the enormous spread in video culture, the emergence of software 
giants, etc. The collaboration of Indian media globally with movies, music, televisions gave rise to the urgent need for copyright protection. Large-scale piracy has not just been 
found in audio cassettes and books as earlier but is also a threat to larger economic models and national ambitions. From the 1980s piracy has been seen in India through production, 
circulation, and regulation of media and culture. Cinematographic piracy is a bit complex as it requires varieties of copyright in single work. Initially, it’s a theatrical right in
 which the distributors buy this right from the producers for the actual viewing of the public. However, these rights are limited to time and territory. Therefore, it is more feasible
  to view the films on video cassettes that do not need cable or satellite connections. Two forms of piracy found in movies are video piracy and cable piracy. </p>
  <p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">In India, there is no definite law to regulate the act of piracy. However, it is governed under the Copyright Act, 1957 that gives protection to all kinds of literary, artistic, musical,
 and dramatic work. This also protects the interest of moviemakers and distributors. One of the objectives behind the Amendment Act of 2012 was to curb the rapid increase in online piracy in India.  
Section 65 A of the Amendment Act secures Technological Protection Measure (TPM) that is used against the breach by the copyright owners. If such breach occurs by evading TPM, then the person could
 be punished with a fine and imprisonment up to 2 years. Section 65B of the Act also protects sensitive information from unauthorized and illegal sites through Information Rights Management. Any alteration
  or intentional removal of IRM would lead to an offence punishable with imprisonment. </p>
  <p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 protects against the online distribution of illegal copies of the pirated contents and if such offence is committed, it can be punished with imprisonment 
for at most 3 years and fined up to 2 lacs.</p> 
<p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Conclusion</p>
<p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Every person has a right to protect their work from being stolen. Lots of financial and mental efforts are required to create such innovative art. Online media piracy has increased with the rapid growth in 
technologies. Both Central and state governments have enforced various anti-piracy reforms and amendments in the Copyright Act to secure the intellectual rights of the right holders. These efforts had proven
 to be successful to much extent. However, in this digital world, it is not easy to eradicate the problem of piracy completely as most of the users are aware of piracy, and it is easily and freely available.</p>
 <p  style="color: #f2f2f2;font-size:13pt; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The recent judgment is a giant step towards blocking the websites and making the enforcement procedure easier for the copyright owners. It can be more beneficial if these directions of the courts could be
 formulated as the policy in India. Due to all such reforms, there might come a time when the users will be notified about the pirated content they are unknowingly accessing.  To make India a piracy-free country,
  many more anti-piracy reforms should be introduced and there should be easy and affordable access to the original content so that the users will no more use pirated content.</p>
